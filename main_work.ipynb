Spellman. lwent\\nthrough avatar training with him.\\n\\n...into the\\nbio-lab.\\n\\nWe\\'re gonna spend\\na lot of time up here.\\n\\nHey! How you doing?\\nNorm, avatar driver.\\n\\n- Hi.\\n- Hey.\\n\\nLink... Here\\'s the link room right here. This\\nis where we\\'re connecting to the avatar.\\n\\nMe and Norm are here to drive these\\nremotely controlled bodies called avatars.\\n\\nAnd they\\'re grown from human DNA\\nmixed with the DNA of the natives.\\n\\n- Hey. Welcome.\\n- Hey.\\n\\n- Welcome to Pandora. Good to have you.\\n- Thanks.\\n\\nDamn! They got big.\\n\\nYeah, they fully mature\\non the flight out.\\n\\nSo the proprioceptive sims\\nseem to work really well.\\n\\nYeah, they\\'ve got\\ngreat muscle tone.\\n\\nIt\\'ll take us a few hours\\nto get them decanted,\\n\\nbut you guys can take\\nthem out tomorrow.\\n\\nThere\\'s yours.\\n\\nHey. Dr. Norm Spellman.\\n\\n- Dr. Max Patel. Great to meet you.\\n- Good to meet you, yeah.\\n\\nLooks like him.\\n\\nNo, it looks like you.\\n\\nThis is your\\navatar now, Jake.\\n\\nAnd the concept is that every driver\\nis matched to his own avatar,\\n\\nso that their nervous\\nsystems are in tune,\\n\\nor something.\\n\\nWhich is why they offered me the gig,\\n\\nbecause I can link with Tommy\\'s avatar,\\n\\nwhich is insanely expensive.\\n\\nIs this right? I just say\\nwhatever to the video log?\\n\\nYeah, we gotta get in the habit\\nof documenting everything.\\n\\nYou know, what we see, what\\nwe feel. It\\'s all part of the science.\\n\\nAnd good science\\nis good observation.\\n\\nPlus it\\'ll help to keep you\\nsane for the next six years.\\n\\nAll right. Whatever.\\n\\nSo...\\n\\nWell, here I am,\\n\\ndoing science.\\n\\nThey\\'re coming out!\\n\\nAttention. Drivers\\ncoming out of link.\\n\\nOh, God.\\n\\nWhere\\'s the lab coat?\\nWhere\\'s the lab coat?\\n\\nWho\\'s got my\\ngoddamn cigarette?\\n\\nGuys!\\n\\nWhat\\'s wrong with this picture?\\n\\nThank you!\\n\\nGrace Augustine\\nis a legend.\\n\\nShe\\'s the head of the Avatar\\nProgram. She wrote the book,\\n\\nI mean, literally wrote the\\nbook on Pandoran botany.\\n\\nWell, that\\'s \\'cause she likes\\nplants better than people.\\n\\nHere she is, Cinderella\\nback from the ball.\\n\\nGrace, I\\'d like you to\\nmeet Norm Spellman\\n\\nand Jake Sully.\\n\\nNorm. I hear good things\\nabout you. How\\'s your Na\\'vi?\\n\\nMay the.

This\\nis Jake Sully.\\n\\nMa\\'am.\\n\\nYeah, yeah. I know who you are,\\nand I don\\'t need you.\\n\\nI need your brother.\\n\\nYou know, the PhD who trained\\n\\nfor three years for this mission?\\n\\nHe\\'s dead. I know it\\'s a big\\ninconvenience for everyone.\\n\\nHow much lab training have you had?\\n\\nI dissected a frog once.\\n\\nYou see?\\n\\nYou see? I mean,\\nthey\\'re just pissing on us\\n\\nwithout even the courtesy\\nof calling it rain.\\n\\n- I\\'m going to Selfridge.\\n- No, Grace,\\n\\n- I don\\'t think that\\'s a good idea.\\n- No, man, this is such bullshit!\\n\\nI\\'m gonna kick\\nhis corporate butt.\\n\\nHe has no business sticking\\nhis nose in my department.\\n\\nHere tomorrow, 0800.\\nTry and use big words.\\n\\nScorpion Two-Hotel, Hell\\'s Gate tower.\\nYou are cleared for south departure.\\n\\nHover taxi, Delta\\nrunway.

You were\\nlooking at the monitor.\\n\\nI love this putter, Ronnie!\\n\\nI love this putter.\\n\\nParker, you know, I used to\\nthink it was benign neglect,\\n\\nbut now I see that you\\'re\\nintentionally screwing me.\\n\\nGrace, you know,\\nI enjoy our little talks.\\n\\nI need a researcher.\\nNot some jarhead dropout.\\n\\nWell, actually, I thought\\nwe got lucky with him.\\n\\n- Lucky?\\n- Yeah.\\n\\nHow is this in any way lucky?\\n\\nLucky your guy\\nhad a twin brother,\\n\\nand lucky that brother wasn\\'t\\nsome oral hygienist or something.\\n\\nA Marine we can use. I\\'m assigning\\nhim to your team as security escort.\\n\\nThe last thing I need is another\\ntrigger-happy moron out there!\\n\\nLook, look, you\\'re supposed to be winning\\nthe hearts and the minds of the natives.\\n\\nIsn\\'t that the whole point\\nof your little puppet show?\\n\\nIf you look like them and you talk\\nlike them, then they\\'ll start trusting us.\\n\\nWe build them a school,\\nwe teach them English,\\n\\nbut after, what, how many years?\\n\\nRelations with the indigenous\\nare only getting worse.\\n\\nYeah, that tends to happen when\\nyou use machine guns on them.\\n\\nRight. Come here.\\n\\nI can\\'t...\\nI can\\'t...\\n\\nThis is why we\\'re\\nhere. Unobtanium.\\n\\nBecause this little gray rock\\nsells for 20 million a kilo.\\n\\nThat\\'s the only reason. It\\'s\\nwhat pays for the whole party.\\n\\nIt\\'s what pays for your science.\\n\\nNow, those savages are\\nthreatening our whole operation,\\n\\nwe\\'re on the brink of war,\\n\\nand you\\'re supposed to be\\nfinding a diplomatic solution.\\n\\nSo use what you\\'ve got,\\nand get me some results.\\n\\n- So, how much link time have you logged?\\n- About 520 hours.\\n\\nThat\\'s good.\\n\\nYou\\'re in there.\\n\\n- You\\'re here.

Just relax and\\nlet your mind go blank.\\n\\nThat shouldn\\'t\\nbe hard for you.\\n\\nKiss the darkest part\\nof my lily white...\\n\\nInitiate link.\\n\\nRun sequence\\nunit three. Go.\\n\\nLaunching.\\n\\nI have the first congruency.\\n\\nThat\\'s a gorgeous\\nbrain. Nice activity.\\n\\nGo figure.\\n\\nPhase-lock 40%.\\n\\nAll right. Going in.\\n\\nI\\'m going in in four.\\n\\nPhase-lock 99%.\\nLink is stable.\\n\\nHe\\'s in.\\n\\nJake, can you hear me?\\nCan you hear me, Jake?\\n\\nPupillary reflex\\nis good.\\n\\nPinna response normal.\\nHow you feeling, Jake?\\n\\nHey, guys.\\n\\nWelcome to your\\nnew body, Jake.\\n\\nGood!\\n\\nYeah, we\\'re gonna take this\\nnice and easy, Jake.\\n\\n- And touch your thumb to your fingers.\\n- Yeah.\\n\\n- Thumb to your fingers.\\n- No problem.\\n\\nThat\\'s good.

Think I felt\\nlike a shavetail louie?\\n\\nYeah. Oh, they could fix\\nme up, if I rotated back.\\n\\nYeah, and make me pretty again.\\n\\nBut you know what?\\nI kind of like it.\\n\\nIt reminds me every day\\nwhat\\'s waiting out there.\\n\\nThe Avatar Program\\nis a bad joke.\\n\\nBunch of limp-dick\\nscience majors.\\n\\nHowever, it does present an opportunity\\n\\nboth timely and unique.\\n\\n- Clear!\\n- Clear!\\n\\nA recon gyrene in an avatar\\nbody. That\\'s a potent mix.\\n\\nGive me the goose bumps.\\nSuch a Marine\\n\\ncould provide the intel I need,\\nright on the ground.\\n\\nRight in the hostiles\\' camp.\\n\\nLook, Sully.

Okay?\\n\\nYou got three months. That\\'s\\nwhen the \\'dozers get there.\\n\\nWell, we\\'re wasting time.\\n\\nI like this guy.\\n\\n- Guys, right now...\\n- Okay, let\\'s run through them again.\\n\\nMo\\' at.\\n\\nDragon lady.\\n\\n- Eytucan.\\n- Eytukan.\\n\\nHe\\'s the clan leader.
